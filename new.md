### Key Features

Here are some of the things you can do with Markdown:

1.  **Bold and Italic Text:** You can make words *italic* or **bold**. You can even make them ***both***.
2.  **Links:** You can add a [link to Google](https://www.google.com).
3.  **Images:** You can embed an image like this: ![A cute cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Cat03.jpg/1200px-Cat03.jpg)

### Code Snippets

You can also include code. Use a single backtick for `inline code`.

For a block of code, use three backticks. You can even specify the language for syntax highlighting.

```python
def example_function(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

example_function("World")
